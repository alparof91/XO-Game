# XO-Game - a small WPF application

These files represent the source files for a small single player XO-game written in C# (WPF-application). 
This is NOT a client-server application, it doesn't use database, your highscores are stored in a local xml file.
The way the computer answers is random, there is no AI implemented in it, so it's easy to win.
This application was made for educational purposes for my own use. Since I'm a beginner it may contain bad concepts in design.
To try it on Windows, you can download the 'WpfApp1.exe' and 'scores.xml' from: WpfApp1\WpfApp1\bin\Debug\ from this repository, or you can download the whole project and compile it in Visual Studio.
Have fun!
